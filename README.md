# BachBenford

Johann Sebastian and Johann Christian Bach were two prolific German composers whose works
are widely listened and played today. David Cope is an American author and composer who
designed a computer algorithm to emulate music from Johann Sebastian Bach. Benford’s Law—or
the Law of First Digits—is a statistical distribution where in a data set of numbers, the numeral one
will be the leading digit 30.1 percent of the time; numeral two will be the leading digit 17.6 percent
of the time; and numerals three to nine will be the leading digits with subsequent decreasing
frequency. This subsequent decrease follows a logarithmic distribution. Widely used to detect
tax fraud, Benford’s Law has multiple applications, including to works done by both German
composers and the computer-generated music. This paper analyzes the distribution of musical
note frequencies in Hertz to see whether they are Benford distributed. Our results show that
JC Bach’s music is more Benford distributed than JS Bach’s music supporting previous research
that music from the classical period is more Benford than music from the Baroque period. We
also found that computer generated music is statistically less Benford distributed than human
composed music.

Here is the software in the form of R code, together with a sample input data set and 
complete documentation of the research process.
